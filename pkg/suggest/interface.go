Package suggest implements prefix completion using Patricia radix tries with frequency ranking.

The suggest package forms the computational core.
It implements some memory management,
capitalization preservation, and frequency thresholds to return relevant suggestions with minimal overhead.

Completer type, which maintains Trie structures for prefix traversal and has memory pools to reduce GC.
Two operational modes are supported: static mode for smaller dictionaries
and lazy for large datasets with chunked loading.

# Trie

The underlying data structure uses the go-patricia library's radix trie impl,
where each node represents a common prefix and stores frequency info.

Words are inserted using their lowercase forms as keys, with frequency values converted to integers.

Trie traversal occurs through the VisitSubtree method, which calls a visitor function for each matching node.
The visitor function processes individual entries, applying freq thresholds and accumulating results
until the count is reached.

Early termination prevents extra traversal when enough suggestions are found.

	trie := patricia.NewTrie()
	trie.Insert(patricia.Prefix("hello"), 1000)
	trie.Insert(patricia.Prefix("help"), 800)

The package handles msgpack type conversions during frequency extraction.
Includes special handling for TS clients (Obsidian for example) that may send freq as float64.

# Memory

Two sync.Pool instances manage mem alloc for suggestion collection and word deduplication.
The suggestion pool has slices with initial capacity of 75 elements,
while the seen words pool maps with 150.

	// Pool lifecycle
	suggestionsPtr := suggestionPool.Get().(*[]Suggestion)
	suggestions := (*suggestionsPtr)[:0]
	defer func() {
		if cap(*suggestionsPtr) > 200 {
			*suggestionsPtr = make([]Suggestion, 0, 75)
		}
		suggestionPool.Put(suggestionsPtr)
	}()

# Lazy

When working with large dictionaries, the Completer comes with the dictionary package's chunk loader to provide ondemand word loading.

it maintains multiple trie states: an active trie from loaded chunks,
a fallback trie built from word frequency maps,
and the completer's internal trie for static words.

The active trie selection follows a priority hierarchy:
chunk loader trie (if available),
fallback trie (if built), then internal trie.

	if activeTrie := c.chunkLoader.GetTrie(); activeTrie != nil {
		return activeTrie
	}
	return c.getFallbackTrie()

Fallback trie construction occurs when the chunk loader has loaded words but hasn't built a consolidated trie.
The completer extracts word frequencies from the loader and constructs a temporary trie
for completion ops.

# Algorithm

The core  performs depth first traversal starting from the root prefix node.
It collects suggestions that meet frequency thresholds while having deduplication through a seen-words map.
Collection stops when reaching 1.5x the requested limit.

Node processing during traversal includes several checks:
exact prefix matches are excluded, duplicate words are filtered, and frequency thresholds are applied before collection.

	err := trie.VisitSubtree(patricia.Prefix(lowerPrefix), func(p patricia.Prefix, item patricia.Item) error {
		if len(suggestions) >= targetLen { return nil }
		word := string(p)
		if seenWords[word] { return nil }
		freq := extractFrequency(item, word)
		if freq < minThreshold { return nil }
		suggestions = append(
				suggestions, Suggestion{Word: word, Frequency: freq})
		seenWords[word] = true
		return nil
	})

Post-traversal processing includes frequency sorting and result limiting.
Final capitalization application occurs after sorting.

# Callback

When requiring zero copy semantics, WordServe provides callback completion that eliminates final result slice allocation.
This mode follows the same traversal and filtering logic but delivers results incrementally through a function.

The callback approach requires collecting and sorting results before delivery to maintain frequency ordering guarantees.
While this introduces temporary allocation, it mainly eliminates the final result copy, which can reduce peak mem usage.

	err := completer.CompleteWithCallback("prefix", 20, func(s Suggestion) bool {
		fmt.Printf("%s (%d)\n", s.Word, s.Frequency)
		return true
	})

# Perf

The implementation achieves sub millisecond completion times consistantly for typical workloads
through several design choices:
radix trie structure provides O(k) lookup where k is prefix length,
memory pools reduce alloc overhead,
early termination prevents unnecessary traversal,
and frequency thresholds filter low relevance results.

Benchmarking on Apple MacBook m4Pro chip shows completion times under 500 microseconds
for common prefixes with dictionaries containing 50,000+ words.

The system scales linearly with dictionary size until memory constraints require chunk-based loading.
At that point, performance depends on chunk loading patterns
and cache hit rates for commonly accessed words.
